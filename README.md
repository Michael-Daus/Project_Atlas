# Project_Atlas
First Project, New Programmer, Help is appreciated, Community and Open Software driven, Awareness.

Hello, all! Greatings, this is going to be my attempt at doing things the right way.
I was a victim of a recent cyber attack, no idea why? I have been doing research into AI and software development using C# languages and Python.
I am continueing my research into programming and code, I hope my project interests anyone because I will be doing it from scratch.

Wish me luck!
With love to all the great Engineers, Developers, and inquisitive ones constantly watching over our cyber security. 
Please be safe out there.
